# symbolic_fractions
A very simple introductory example to symbolic calculus : fraction manipulation 
The program consists of a jupyter notebook, where a fraction class is created, associated with some basic methods to manipulate fractions as python classes.
Some python libraries, the ones imported, are necessary for the program to work. 
For the symbolic diffusion we used latex in the base code, then converted into images in the temporary memory to show the results in the GUI. 
To make the GUI we used the Tkinter library in python. 
Having the required libraries ( we can avoid this using images, but it needs further optimization ) will allow to use the excutable file directly on windows. 
This program is meant only to show the most basic example of symbolic calculus. Let them fractions go !
